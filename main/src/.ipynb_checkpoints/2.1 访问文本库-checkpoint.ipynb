That will be ere the set of Sunne\\n\\n   1. Where the place?\\n  2. Vpon the Heath\\n\\n   3. There to meet with Macbeth\\n\\n   1. I come, Gray-Malkin\\n\\n   All. Padock calls anon: faire is foule, and foule is faire,\\nHouer through the fogge and filthie ayre.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nAlarum within. Enter King Malcome, Donalbaine, Lenox, with\\nattendants,\\nmeeting a bleeding Captaine.\\n\\n  King. What bloody man is that? he can report,\\nAs seemeth by his plight, of the Reuolt\\nThe newest state\\n\\n   Mal. This is the Serieant,\\nWho like a good and hardie Souldier fought\\n'Gainst my Captiuitie: Haile braue friend;\\nSay to the King, the knowledge of the Broyle,\\nAs thou didst leaue it\\n\\n   Cap. Doubtfull it stood,\\nAs two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,\\nAnd choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald\\n(Worthie to be a Rebell, for to that\\nThe multiplying Villanies of Nature\\nDoe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne Isles\\nOf Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,\\nAnd Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,\\nShew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:\\nFor braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)\\nDisdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,\\nWhich smoak'd with bloody execution\\n(Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,\\nTill hee fac'd the Slaue:\\nWhich neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,\\nTill he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,\\nAnd fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements\\n\\n   King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman\\n\\n   Cap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,\\nShipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:\\nSo from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,\\nDiscomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,\\nNo sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,\\nCompell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,\\nBut the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,\\nWith furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,\\nBegan a fresh assault\\n\\n   King.

Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;\\nOr the Hare, the Lyon:\\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\\nAs Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,\\nSo they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:\\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,\\nOr memorize another Golgotha,\\nI cannot tell: but I am faint,\\nMy Gashes cry for helpe\\n\\n   King. So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,\\nThey smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.\\nEnter Rosse and Angus.\\n\\nWho comes here?\\n  Mal. The worthy Thane of Rosse\\n\\n   Lenox. What a haste lookes through his eyes?\\nSo should he looke, that seemes to speake things strange\\n\\n   Rosse. God saue the King\\n\\n   King. Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?\\n  Rosse. From Fiffe, great King,\\nWhere the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,\\nAnd fanne our people cold.\\nNorway himselfe, with terrible numbers,\\nAssisted by that most disloyall Traytor,\\nThe Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,\\nTill that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,\\nConfronted him with selfe-comparisons,\\nPoint against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,\\nCurbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,\\nThe Victorie fell on vs\\n\\n   King.

So foule and faire a day I haue not seene\\n\\n   Banquo. How farre is't call'd to Soris? What are these,\\nSo wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,\\nThat looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,\\nAnd yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught\\nThat man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,\\nBy each at once her choppie finger laying\\nVpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,\\nAnd yet your Beards forbid me to interprete\\nThat you are so\\n\\n   Mac. Speake if you can: what are you?\\n  1. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Glamis\\n\\n   2. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Cawdor\\n\\n   3. All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter\\n\\n   Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare\\nThings that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth\\nAre ye fantasticall, or that indeed\\nWhich outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner\\nYou greet with present Grace, and great prediction\\nOf Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,\\nThat he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.\\nIf you can looke into the Seedes of Time,\\nAnd say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,\\nSpeake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare\\nYour fauors, nor your hate\\n\\n   1. Hayle\\n\\n   2. Hayle\\n\\n   3. Hayle\\n\\n   1. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater\\n\\n   2. Not so happy, yet much happyer\\n\\n   3. Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:\\nSo all haile Macbeth, and Banquo\\n\\n   1. Banquo, and Macbeth, all haile\\n\\n   Macb. Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:\\nBy Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,\\nBut how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues\\nA prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,\\nStands not within the prospect of beleefe,\\nNo more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence\\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\\nVpon this blasted Heath you stop our way\\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\\nSpeake, I charge you.\\n\\nWitches vanish.\\n\\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,\\nAnd these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?\\n  Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,\\nMelted, as breath into the Winde.\\nWould they had stay'd\\n\\n   Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?\\nOr haue we eaten on the insane Root,\\nThat takes the Reason Prisoner?\\n  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings\\n\\n   Banq. You shall be King\\n\\n   Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?\\n  Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?\\nEnter Rosse and Angus.\\n\\n  Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,\\nThe newes of thy successe: and when he reades\\nThy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,\\nHis Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,\\nWhich should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,\\nIn viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,\\nHe findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,\\nNothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make\\nStrange Images of death, as thick as Tale\\nCan post with post, and euery one did beare\\nThy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,\\nAnd powr'd them downe before him\\n\\n   Ang. Wee are sent,\\nTo giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,\\nOnely to harrold thee into his sight,\\nNot pay thee\\n\\n   Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,\\nHe bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\\nIn which addition, haile most worthy Thane,\\nFor it is thine\\n\\n   Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?\\n  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:\\nWhy doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?\\n  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,\\nBut vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,\\nWhich he deserues to loose.\\nWhether he was combin'd with those of Norway,\\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,\\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\\nIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:\\nBut Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,\\nHaue ouerthrowne him\\n\\n   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:\\nThe greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.\\nDoe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,\\nWhen those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,\\nPromis'd no lesse to them\\n\\n   Banq. That trusted home,\\nMight yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,\\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\\nAnd oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,\\nThe Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,\\nWinne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's\\nIn deepest consequence.\\nCousins, a word, I pray you\\n\\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\\nAs happy Prologues to the swelling Act\\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\\nThis supernaturall solliciting\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\\nIf ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\nWhose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\nAgainst the vse of Nature? Present Feares\\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\\nMy Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\\nShakes so my single state of Man,\\nThat Function is smother'd in surmise,\\nAnd nothing is, but what is not\\n\\n   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt\\n\\n   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,\\nWhy Chance may Crowne me,\\nWithout my stirre\\n\\n   Banq. New Honors come vpon him\\nLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,\\nBut with the aid of vse\\n\\n   Macb. Come what come may,\\nTime, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day\\n\\n   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure\\n\\n   Macb. Giue me your fauour:\\nMy dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.\\nKinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,\\nWhere euery day I turne the Leafe,\\nTo reade them.\\nLet vs toward the King: thinke vpon\\nWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,\\nThe Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake\\nOur free Hearts each to other\\n\\n   Banq. Very gladly\\n\\n   Macb. Till then enough:\\nCome friends.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n\\nScena Quarta.\\n\\nFlourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme, Donalbaine, and\\nAttendants.\\n\\n  King. Is execution done on Cawdor?\\nOr not those in Commission yet return'd?\\n  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.\\nBut I haue spoke with one that saw him die:\\nWho did report, that very frankly hee\\nConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,\\nAnd set forth a deepe Repentance:\\nNothing in his Life became him,\\nLike the leauing it. Hee dy'de,\\nAs one that had beene studied in his death,\\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,\\nAs 'twere a carelesse Trifle\\n\\n   King. There's no Art,\\nTo finde the Mindes construction in the Face.\\nHe was a Gentleman, on whom I built\\nAn absolute Trust.\\nEnter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.\\n\\nO worthyest Cousin,\\nThe sinne of my Ingratitude euen now\\nWas heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,\\nThat swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,\\nTo ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,\\nThat the proportion both of thanks, and payment,\\nMight haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,\\nMore is thy due, then more then all can pay\\n\\n   Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,\\nIn doing it, payes it selfe.\\nYour Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:\\nAnd our Duties are to your Throne, and State,\\nChildren, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,\\nBy doing euery thing safe toward your Loue\\nAnd Honor\\n\\n   King. Welcome hither:\\nI haue begun to plant thee, and will labour\\nTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,\\nThat hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne\\nNo lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,\\nAnd hold thee to my Heart\\n\\n   Banq. There if I grow,\\nThe Haruest is your owne\\n\\n   King. My plenteous Ioyes,\\nWanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues\\nIn drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,\\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know,\\nWe will establish our Estate vpon\\nOur eldest, Malcolme, whom we name hereafter,\\nThe Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must\\nNot vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,\\nBut signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine\\nOn all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,\\nAnd binde vs further to you\\n\\n   Macb. The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:\\nIle be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull\\nThe hearing of my Wife, with your approach:\\nSo humbly take my leaue\\n\\n   King. My worthy Cawdor\\n\\n   Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,\\nOn which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,\\nFor in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,\\nLet not Light see my black and deepe desires:\\nThe Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,\\nWhich the Eye feares, when it is done to see.\\nEnter.\\n\\n  King. True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,\\nAnd in his commendations, I am fed:\\nIt is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,\\nWhose care is gone before, to bid vs welcome:\\nIt is a peerelesse Kinsman.\\n\\nFlourish. Exeunt.\\n\\n\\nScena Quinta.\\n\\nEnter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter.\\n\\n  Lady. They met me in the day of successe: and I haue\\nlearn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then\\nmortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them\\nfurther, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.\\nWhiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from\\nthe King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title\\nbefore, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to\\nthe comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This\\nhaue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of\\nGreatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing\\nby being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay\\nit to thy heart and farewell.\\nGlamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be\\nWhat thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,\\nIt is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,\\nTo catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,\\nArt not without Ambition, but without\\nThe illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,\\nThat would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,\\nAnd yet would'st wrongly winne.\\nThould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,\\nThus thou must doe, if thou haue it;\\nAnd that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,\\nThen wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,\\nThat I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,\\nAnd chastise with the valour of my Tongue\\nAll that impeides thee from the Golden Round,\\nWhich Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme\\nTo haue thee crown'd withall.\\nEnter Messenger.\\n\\nWhat is your tidings?\\n  Mess. The King comes here to Night\\n\\n   Lady. Thou'rt mad to say it.\\nIs not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,\\nWould haue inform'd for preparation\\n\\n   Mess. So please you, it is true: our Thane is comming:\\nOne of my fellowes had the speed of him;\\nWho almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\\nThen would make vp his Message\\n\\n   Lady. Giue him tending,\\nHe brings great newes,\\n\\nExit Messenger.\\n\\nThe Rauen himselfe is hoarse,\\nThat croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan\\nVnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,\\nThat tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,\\nAnd fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top-full\\nOf direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,\\nStop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,\\nThat no compunctious visitings of Nature\\nShake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweene\\nTh' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,\\nAnd take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,\\nWhere-euer, in your sightlesse substances,\\nYou wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,\\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,\\n\\nThat my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,\\nNor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,\\nTo cry, hold, hold.\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\nGreat Glamys, worthy Cawdor,\\nGreater then both, by the all-haile hereafter,\\nThy Letters haue transported me beyond\\nThis ignorant present, and I feele now\\nThe future in the instant\\n\\n   Macb. My dearest Loue,\\nDuncan comes here to Night\\n\\n   Lady. And when goes hence?\\n  Macb. To morrow, as he purposes\\n\\n   Lady. O neuer,\\nShall Sunne that Morrow see.\\nYour Face, my Thane, is as a Booke, where men\\nMay reade strange matters, to beguile the time.\\nLooke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,\\nYour Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,\\nBut be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,\\nMust be prouided for: and you shall put\\nThis Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,\\nWhich shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,\\nGiue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome\\n\\n   Macb. We will speake further,\\n  Lady. Onely looke vp cleare:\\nTo alter fauor, euer is to feare:\\nLeaue all the rest to me.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n\\nScena Sexta.\\n\\nHoboyes, and Torches.

This Castle hath a pleasant seat,\\nThe ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe\\nVnto our gentle sences\\n\\n   Banq. This Guest of Summer,\\nThe Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,\\nBy his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath\\nSmells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,\\nButtrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird\\nHath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,\\nWhere they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd\\nThe ayre is delicate.\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\n  King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:\\nThe Loue that followes vs, sometime is our trouble,\\nWhich still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,\\nHow you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,\\nAnd thanke vs for your trouble\\n\\n   Lady.

Where's the Thane of Cawdor?\\nWe courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose\\nTo be his Purueyor: But he rides well,\\nAnd his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him\\nTo his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse\\nWe are your guest to night\\n\\n   La. Your Seruants euer,\\nHaue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,\\nTo make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,\\nStill to returne your owne\\n\\n   King. Giue me your hand:\\nConduct me to mine Host we loue him highly,\\nAnd shall continue, our Graces towards him.\\nBy your leaue Hostesse.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Septima.\\n\\nHoboyes. Torches. Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes\\nand\\nSeruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth\\n\\n   Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,\\nIt were done quickly: If th' Assassination\\nCould trammell vp the Consequence, and catch\\nWith his surcease, Successe: that but this blow\\nMight be the be all, and the end all. Heere,\\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\\nWee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,\\nWe still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach\\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\\nTo plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\\nCommends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice\\nTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;\\nFirst, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,\\nStrong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,\\nWho should against his Murtherer shut the doore,\\nNot beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane\\nHath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin\\nSo cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues\\nWill pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against\\nThe deepe damnation of his taking off:\\nAnd Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,\\nStriding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd\\nVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,\\nShall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,\\nThat teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre\\nTo pricke the sides of my intent, but onely\\nVaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,\\nAnd falles on th' other.\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\nHow now? What Newes?\\n  La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?\\n  Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?\\n  La. Know you not, he ha's?\\n  Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:\\nHe hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought\\nGolden Opinions from all sorts of people,\\nWhich would be worne now in their newest glosse,\\nNot cast aside so soone\\n\\n   La. Was the hope drunke,\\nWherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\nSuch I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\nAs thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\nLetting I dare not, wait vpon I would,\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\n\\n   Macb. Prythee peace:\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\nWho dares do more, is none\\n\\n   La. What Beast was't then\\nThat made you breake this enterprize to me?\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\\nAnd to be more then what you were, you would\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time, nor place\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\nThey haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know\\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\\nI would, while it was smyling in my Face,\\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,\\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\\nAs you haue done to this\\n\\n   Macb. If we should faile?\\n  Lady. We faile?\\nBut screw your courage to the sticking place,\\nAnd wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,\\n(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney\\nSoundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines\\nWill I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,\\nThat Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,\\nShall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason\\nA Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,\\nTheir drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,\\nWhat cannot you and I performe vpon\\nTh' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon\\nHis spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt\\nOf our great quell\\n\\n   Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:\\nFor thy vndaunted Mettle should compose\\nNothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,\\nWhen we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two\\nOf his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,\\nThat they haue don't?\\n  Lady. Who dares receiue it other,\\nAs we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,\\nVpon his Death?\\n  Macb. I am settled, and bend vp\\nEach corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.\\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show,\\nFalse Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\n\\nActus Secundus.

Hold, take my Sword:\\nThere's Husbandry in Heauen,\\nTheir Candles are all out: take thee that too.\\nA heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,\\nAnd yet I would not sleepe:\\nMercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts\\nThat Nature giues way to in repose.\\nEnter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.\\n\\nGiue me my Sword: who's there?\\n  Macb. A Friend\\n\\n   Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.\\nHe hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,\\nAnd sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.\\nThis Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,\\nBy the name of most kind Hostesse,\\nAnd shut vp in measurelesse content\\n\\n   Mac. Being vnprepar'd,\\nOur will became the seruant to defect,\\nWhich else should free haue wrought\\n\\n   Banq. All's well.\\nI dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:\\nTo you they haue shew'd some truth\\n\\n   Macb. I thinke not of them:\\nYet when we can entreat an houre to serue,\\nWe would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,\\nIf you would graunt the time\\n\\n   Banq. At your kind'st leysure\\n\\n   Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,\\nWhen 'tis, it shall make Honor for you\\n\\n   Banq. So I lose none,\\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keepe\\nMy Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,\\nI shall be counsail'd\\n\\n   Macb. Good repose the while\\n\\n   Banq.

Come, let me clutch thee:\\nI haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.\\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\\nTo feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?\\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\\nAs this which now I draw.\\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going,\\nAnd such an Instrument I was to vse.\\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\nAnd on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\\nIt is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\nThe Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\\nAlarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\nMoues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth\\nHeare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:\\nWords to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.\\n\\nA Bell rings.\\n\\nI goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.\\nHeare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,\\nThat summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.\\nEnter.\\n\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\n  La.

I haue drugg'd their Possets,\\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\\nWhether they liue, or dye.\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macb. Who's there? what hoa?\\n  Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,\\nAnd 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,\\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\\nMy Father as he slept, I had don't.\\nMy Husband?\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\nDidst thou not heare a noyse?\\n  Lady.

Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\n\\n   Mac. This is a sorry sight\\n\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\n\\n   Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\n\\n   Lady. There are two lodg'd together\\n\\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\nListning their feare, I could not say Amen,\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\n\\n   Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\n\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\n\\n   Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will make vs mad\\n\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\nMacbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\nBalme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\nChiefe nourisher in Life's Feast\\n\\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\\n  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:\\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\nShall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\n\\n   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\nAnd wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from the place?\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\nThe sleepie Groomes with blood\\n\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\nI am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:\\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\\n\\n   Lady. Infirme of purpose:\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\nAre but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\nThat feares a painted Deuill.

Whence is that knocking?\\nHow is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?\\nWhat Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.\\nWill all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood\\nCleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather\\nThe multitudinous Seas incarnardine,\\nMaking the Greene one, Red.\\nEnter Lady.\\n\\n  Lady.

Here's a Farmer, that hang'd\\nhimselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue\\nNapkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.\\n\\nKnock.\\n\\nKnock, knock.

Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\nmuch Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\nit makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\nhim; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,\\nequiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,\\nleaues him\\n\\n   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night\\n\\n   Port. That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I\\nrequited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong\\nfor him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I\\nmade a Shift to cast him.\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macd.

Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:\\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\nThou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,\\nWhy do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!\\nWhat will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:\\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\\nWhich shewes me many more: and some I see,\\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.\\nHorrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,\\nFor the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,\\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\\n  1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\\nCome Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,\\nAnd shew the best of our delights.\\nIle Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,\\nWhile you performe your Antique round:\\nThat this great King may kindly say,\\nOur duties, did his welcome pay.\\n\\nMusicke.

From this moment,\\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\\nTo Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\nSeize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules\\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\\nThis deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\\nBut no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?\\nCome bring me where they are.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Secunda.\\n\\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\\n\\n  Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam\\n\\n   Wife. He had none:\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\n\\n   Rosse. You know not\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\n\\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\nSo runnes against all reason\\n\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\nTo what they were before.

With what I get I meane, and so do they\\n\\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\\nThou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,\\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\\n\\n   Son.

Nay how will you do for a Husband?\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\n\\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\n\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\n\\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\n\\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\n\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\n\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\nAnd must be hang'd\\n\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\n  Wife. Euery one\\n\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\n\\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\\nand hang vp them\\n\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\\nhaue a new Father\\n\\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\nI dare abide no longer.\\n\\nExit Messenger\\n\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\nWhat are these faces?\\nEnter Murtherers.\\n\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\\n\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\n\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\\n\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\n  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\nRun away I pray you.\\n\\nExit crying Murther.\\n\\n\\nScaena Tertia.\\n\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\n\\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\\n\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\nLike Syllable of Dolour\\n\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\\nT' appease an angry God\\n\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\n\\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\n\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\n\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\n\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\n\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\nBy him that shall succeede\\n\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\n\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\n\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\nThen such an one to reigne\\n\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\nFinding it so inclinde\\n\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\nDestroying them for wealth\\n\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\n\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\nAll vnity on earth\\n\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\n\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\nI am as I haue spoken\\n\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\nThy hope ends heere\\n\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\nEnter a Doctor.\\n\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\nI pray you?\\n  Doct.

With this strange vertue,\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\nEnter Rosse.\\n\\n  Macd. See who comes heere\\n\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\\n\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\n\\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\n\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\n\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\n\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\n\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\n\\n   Macd.

No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\n\\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\nThat Christendome giues out\\n\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\n\\n   Macd. What concerne they,\\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\\nDue to some single brest?\\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\nPertaines to you alone\\n\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\n\\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\\nthat euer yet they heard\\n\\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\\n\\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\nTo adde the death of you\\n\\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\\n\\n   Macd.

Seyton, I am sick at hart,\\nWhen I behold: Seyton, I say, this push\\nWill cheere me euer, or dis-eate me now.\\nI haue liu'd long enough: my way of life\\nIs falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,\\nAnd that which should accompany Old-Age,\\nAs Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,\\nI must not looke to haue: but in their steed,\\nCurses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth-honor, breath\\nWhich the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.\\nSeyton?\\nEnter Seyton.\\n\\n  Sey. What's your gracious pleasure?\\n  Macb. What Newes more?\\n  Sey. All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported\\n\\n   Macb. Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.\\nGiue me my Armor\\n\\n   Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet\\n\\n   Macb. Ile put it on:\\nSend out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,\\nHang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:\\nHow do's your Patient, Doctor?\\n  Doct. Not so sicke my Lord,\\nAs she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies\\nThat keepe her from her rest\\n\\n   Macb. Cure of that:\\nCan'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,\\nPlucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,\\nRaze out the written troubles of the Braine,\\nAnd with some sweet Obliuious Antidote\\nCleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe\\nWhich weighes vpon the heart?\\n  Doct. Therein the Patient\\nMust minister to himselfe\\n\\n   Macb. Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.\\nCome, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:\\nSeyton, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:\\nCome sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast\\nThe Water of my Land, finde her Disease,\\nAnd purge it to a sound and pristine Health,\\nI would applaud thee to the very Eccho,\\nThat should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,\\nWhat Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue drugge\\nWould scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?\\n  Doct. I my good Lord: your Royall Preparation\\nMakes vs heare something\\n\\n   Macb. Bring it after me:\\nI will not be affraid of Death and Bane,\\nTill Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane\\n\\n   Doct.

Cosins, I hope the dayes are neere at hand\\nThat Chambers will be safe\\n\\n   Ment. We doubt it nothing\\n\\n   Seyw. What wood is this before vs?\\n  Ment. The wood of Birnane\\n\\n   Malc. Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough,\\nAnd bear't before him, thereby shall we shadow\\nThe numbers of our Hoast, and make discouery\\nErre in report of vs\\n\\n   Sold. It shall be done\\n\\n   Syw. We learne no other, but the confident Tyrant\\nKeepes still in Dunsinane, and will indure\\nOur setting downe befor't\\n\\n   Malc. 'Tis his maine hope:\\nFor where there is aduantage to be giuen,\\nBoth more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,\\nAnd none serue with him, but constrained things,\\nWhose hearts are absent too\\n\\n   Macd. Let our iust Censures\\nAttend the true euent, and put we on\\nIndustrious Souldiership\\n\\n   Sey. The time approaches,\\nThat will with due decision make vs know\\nWhat we shall say we haue, and what we owe:\\nThoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,\\nBut certaine issue, stroakes must arbitrate,\\nTowards which, aduance the warre.\\n\\nExeunt. marching\\n\\nScena Quinta.\\n\\nEnter Macbeth, Seyton, & Souldiers, with Drum and Colours.\\n\\n  Macb.

What is that noyse?\\n\\nA Cry within of Women.\\n\\n  Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord\\n\\n   Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:\\nThe time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd\\nTo heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire\\nWould at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre\\nAs life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,\\nDirenesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts\\nCannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?\\n  Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead\\n\\n   Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;\\nThere would haue beene a time for such a word:\\nTo morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,\\nCreepes in this petty pace from day to day,\\nTo the last Syllable of Recorded time:\\nAnd all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles\\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,\\nLife's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,\\nThat struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,\\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a Tale\\nTold by an Ideot, full of sound and fury\\nSignifying nothing.\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\nThou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly\\n\\n   Mes. Gracious my Lord,\\nI should report that which I say I saw,\\nBut know not how to doo't\\n\\n   Macb. Well, say sir\\n\\n   Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill\\nI look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought\\nThe Wood began to moue\\n\\n   Macb. Lyar, and Slaue\\n\\n   Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:\\nWithin this three Mile may you see it comming.\\nI say, a mouing Groue\\n\\n   Macb. If thou speak'st false,\\nVpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue\\nTill Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,\\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.\\nI pull in Resolution, and begin\\nTo doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,\\nThat lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood\\nDo come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood\\nComes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,\\nIf this which he auouches, do's appeare,\\nThere is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.\\nI 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,\\nAnd wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.\\nRing the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,\\nAt least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Sexta.\\n\\nDrumme and Colours. Enter Malcolme, Seyward, Macduffe, and\\ntheir Army,\\nwith Boughes.\\n\\n  Mal. Now neere enough:\\nYour leauy Skreenes throw downe,\\nAnd shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)\\nShall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne\\nLeade our first Battell. Worthy Macduffe, and wee\\nShall take vpon's what else remaines to do,\\nAccording to our order\\n\\n   Sey. Fare you well:\\nDo we but finde the Tyrants power to night,\\nLet vs be beaten, if we cannot fight\\n\\n   Macd. Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breath\\nThose clamorous Harbingers of Blood, & Death.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nAlarums continued.\\n\\n\\nScena Septima.\\n\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macb. They haue tied me to a stake, I cannot flye,\\nBut Beare-like I must fight the course. What's he\\nThat was not borne of Woman? Such a one\\nAm I to feare, or none.\\nEnter young Seyward.\\n\\n  Y.Sey. What is thy name?\\n  Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it\\n\\n   Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name\\nThen any is in hell\\n\\n   Macb. My name's Macbeth\\n\\n   Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title\\nMore hatefull to mine eare\\n\\n   Macb. No: nor more fearefull\\n\\n   Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword\\nIle proue the lye thou speak'st.\\n\\nFight, and young Seyward slaine.\\n\\n  Macb. Thou was't borne of woman;\\nBut Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,\\nBrandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.\\nEnter.\\n\\nAlarums. Enter Macduffe.\\n\\n  Macd. That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,\\nIf thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,\\nMy Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:\\nI cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes\\nAre hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,\\nOr else my Sword with an vnbattered edge\\nI sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,\\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\\nSeemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,\\nAnd more I begge not.\\n\\nExit. Alarums.\\n\\nEnter Malcolme and Seyward.\\n\\n  Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:\\nThe Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,\\nThe Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,\\nThe day almost it selfe professes yours,\\nAnd little is to do\\n\\n   Malc. We haue met with Foes\\nThat strike beside vs\\n\\n   Sey. Enter Sir, the Castle.\\n\\nExeunt. Alarum\\n\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macb. Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dye\\nOn mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashes\\nDo better vpon them.\\nEnter Macduffe.\\n\\n  Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne\\n\\n   Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:\\nBut get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd\\nWith blood of thine already\\n\\n   Macd. I haue no words,\\nMy voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine\\nThen tearmes can giue thee out.\\n\\nFight: Alarum\\n\\n  Macb. Thou loosest labour\\nAs easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre\\nWith thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:\\nLet fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,\\nI beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld\\nTo one of woman borne\\n\\n   Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,\\nAnd let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd\\nTell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb\\nVntimely ript\\n\\n   Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;\\nFor it hath Cow'd my better part of man:\\nAnd be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,\\nThat palter with vs in a double sence,\\nThat keepe the word of promise to our eare,\\nAnd breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee\\n\\n   Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,\\nAnd liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.\\nWee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are\\nPainted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,\\nHeere may you see the Tyrant\\n\\n   Macb. I will not yeeld\\nTo kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,\\nAnd to be baited with the Rabbles curse.\\nThough Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,\\nAnd thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,\\nYet I will try the last. Before my body,\\nI throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,\\nAnd damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.\\n\\nExeunt. fighting. Alarums.\\n\\nEnter Fighting, and Macbeth slaine.\\n\\nRetreat, and Flourish. Enter with Drumme and Colours, Malcolm,\\nSeyward,\\nRosse, Thanes, & Soldiers.\\n\\n  Mal. I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd\\n\\n   Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,\\nSo great a day as this is cheapely bought\\n\\n   Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne\\n\\n   Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,\\nHe onely liu'd but till he was a man,\\nThe which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd\\nIn the vnshrinking station where he fought,\\nBut like a man he dy'de\\n\\n   Sey. Then he is dead?\\n  Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow\\nMust not be measur'd by his worth, for then\\nIt hath no end\\n\\n   Sey. Had he his hurts before?\\n  Rosse. I, on the Front\\n\\n   Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:\\nHad I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,\\nI would not wish them to a fairer death:\\nAnd so his Knell is knoll'd\\n\\n   Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,\\nand that Ile spend for him\\n\\n   Sey. He's worth no more,\\nThey say he parted well, and paid his score,\\nAnd so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.\\nEnter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.\\n\\n  Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.\\nBehold where stands\\nTh' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:\\nI see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,\\nThat speake my salutation in their minds:\\nWhose voyces I desire alowd with mine.\\nHaile King of Scotland\\n\\n   All. Haile King of Scotland.\\n\\nFlourish.\\n\\n  Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,\\nBefore we reckon with your seuerall loues,\\nAnd make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen\\nHenceforth be Earles, the first that euer Scotland\\nIn such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,\\nWhich would be planted newly with the time,\\nAs calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,\\nThat fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,\\nProducing forth the cruell Ministers\\nOf this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;\\nWho (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,\\nTooke off her life. This, and what need full else\\nThat call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,\\nWe will performe in measure, time, and place:\\nSo thankes to all at once, and to each one,\\nWhom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.\\n\\nFlourish.
